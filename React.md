## Project Ideas

1. **Vocabulary Memorization Website**  
   Create an app for language learners to manage vocabulary.  
   Start with a form for inserting words — one for your native language and another for the foreign language.

2. **Recipe Finder**  
   Search for recipes using a public API and display images, ingredients, and instructions.

3. **Real-Time Chat Application**  
   Integrate **Firebase** for live messaging, showing active users, and message timestamps.

## Pre-Read Template (Before a Session / Masterclass)

### Title:
**React.js**

### Goal:
Participants should have a **basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** before attending.  
They should know how to structure webpages, style elements, and write simple interactive scripts.  
Familiarity with variables, functions, and DOM manipulation helps grasp React’s **component-based architecture** and **state management** effectively.
