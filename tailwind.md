## Pre-Read Template (Before a Session / Masterclass)

### Title:
**Tailwind CSS**

### Goal:
Before attending, participants should have a **basic understanding of HTML and CSS** — how elements are structured and styled.  
Familiarity with **class selectors** and **responsive design concepts** will help participants grasp Tailwind’s utility-based approach more easily.  
If participants know some **React** or **JavaScript**, it will be a plus when exploring Tailwind integration with component-based UIs.
